# ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ≠ÿØŸä - ŸÑÿπÿ®ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿßÿ≥Ÿàÿ≥ üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A modern, mobile-friendly spy game built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript, featuring a complete card-flipping system, fair randomization, and multiplayer voting mechanics.

## üéÆ Game Overview

**ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ≠ÿØŸä** (The Challenge) is a digital version of the classic spy game where players must identify the spy among them. The game features a unique card-flipping system where each player privately views their role before the questioning phase begins.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üé¥ Card Flipping System
- **Private Role Reveal**: Each player flips a card to see their role (word or spy)
- **2-Second Display**: Cards show for exactly 2 seconds before passing to next player
- **Visual Progress**: Dots show which players have flipped their cards
- **Automatic Progression**: Game automatically moves to questions phase after all cards are flipped

### üéØ Fair Randomization
- **Ultra-Fair Selection**: Uses cryptographic random numbers with multiple entropy sources
- **History Tracking**: Tracks last 20 games to ensure all players get equal spy opportunities
- **Anti-Bias Logic**: Only selects from players who have been spy least frequently
- **True Randomness**: Falls back to enhanced Math.random with multiple entropy sources

### ‚è∞ Game Phases
1. **Card Flipping**: Each player privately views their role
2. **Questions**: 5-minute timer with random turn order
3. **Voting**: All players vote on who they think is the spy
4. **Results**: Reveals the spy, word, and voting results

### üåç Multi-Language Support

## üéØ Game Logic

### Spy Selection Algorithm
```typescript
// Ultra-fair spy selection with history tracking
const getFairSpyIndex = (playerCount: number) => {
  // If no history, use pure random
  if (spyHistory.length === 0) {
    return getUltraRandomInt(playerCount);
  }
  
  // Count recent spy occurrences
  const recentHistory = spyHistory.slice(-20);
  const spyCounts = new Array(playerCount).fill(0);
  
  // Find players who have been spy least frequently
  const minCount = Math.min(...spyCounts);
  const leastFrequentPlayers = spyCounts
    .map((count, index) => count === minCount ? index : -1)
    .filter(index => index !== -1);
  
  // Randomly select from least frequent players
  return leastFrequentPlayers[getUltraRandomInt(leastFrequentPlayers.length)];
};
```

### Randomization System
- **Primary**: `crypto.getRandomValues()` for cryptographic randomness
- **Fallback**: Enhanced Math.random with multiple entropy sources
- **Entropy Sources**: Performance timing, date, multiple random calls
- **Mixing**: XOR combination + additional cryptographic mixing

### Game Flow
1. **Setup**: Select 3-9 players and category
2. **Card Flipping**: Each player flips card to see role (2 seconds)
3. **Questions**: 5-minute timer with random turn order
4. **Voting**: All players vote on suspected spy
5. **Results**: Reveal spy, word, and voting statistics
